            <p>I love all the nerdy stuff. Comic books, Marvel and DC stories, with Spiderman and Batman being my favorite characters from each respectively. I have a pretty wide-ranging taste in videogames that span from indie metroidvanias like Hollow Knight to triple A titles like God of War. I also enjoy listening jazz and K pop music, and my favorite TV shows are mostly K Dramas. I also enjoy cooking and I find a lot of parallels between cookingg and coding, particularly when it comes to trying out new ideas.</p>
